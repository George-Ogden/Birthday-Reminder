# Birthday Reminder
This is a birthday reminder. You can save birthdays and delete them.
It uses GUI so it is interactive.
You can customise each birthday.
Every day, the date is displayed and you can see any upcoming birthdays over the fornight. 

Bugs: this has not been fully tested. 
Remember to often save a backup copy of your birthdays in case there is an error when loading the program.

For the executable file, goto /Birthday Reminder/dist/Birthday Reminder/Birthday Reminder.exe

I have commented most of the code and there are celebrity birthdays in a separate branch.
